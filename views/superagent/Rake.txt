How the money will work
Lets say we have 3 users A B C
Each one has 100 usd in their accounts
ali is their direct agent
and hadi is the superagent ( the person who created ali's account)
lets say that A won all the money so now he has 300k - 3% of 300k which are equal to 291k
Ali has 300k 
Ali has to pay A 260k
